name: Database Migration Check

# This workflow validates database migrations on pull requests.
# It ensures migrations are properly formatted and can be applied without errors.
# Note: This workflow only validates migrations - it does NOT deploy to production.
# Production deployment requires manual triggering via the 'Promote Database Migrations' workflow.
